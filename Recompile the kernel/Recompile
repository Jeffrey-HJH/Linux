It need to recompile the linux kernel after assign system call id.

Step :
step one : get into the kernel folder.
          {
            cd /usr/src/linux-4.18.14
          }

step two : Delete junk files generated by previous compilation.
          {
            sudo make mrproper
            sudo make clean
            sudo make menuconfig (do not need to do anything after enter this commend, just save and exit)
          }

step three : recompile kernel
          {
            sudo make -j4  (the number after "j" is depend on your computer, my lattop is 4 cores thus I use "-j4".This step will take a very lone time.)
          }
